GAM

****
S() 
For continous non linear predictor. With the by argument we can define categorical interactions of another variable. 
Example: s(x, by = y). Where x is continous and y is categorical.
****

****
ti()
This is for continous by continous interactions 

modelTI =  s(Age) + s(Freq) + ti(Age,Freq)
****


*****
te()
This one is very similiar to ti() but the summary output also includes main effects.
To model modelTI with te(), we just do modelTE = te(Age,Freq). In that sense they are almost identical. but te has less degrees of frededom
modelTE smooths out more than the modelTI.
